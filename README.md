# unrealVisualStudioCodeProjectFileGenerator
Creating project files for the Visual Studio Code environment is painful, especially if the project will not compile and you cannot generate the files from the editor.

This is a small bat file to create visual studio code project files and linkages for your Unreal Projects.

Once executed, a workspace will be created and the source code linked allowing for intellisense completion, debug sessions, and build commands from the Visual Studio Code GUI.
